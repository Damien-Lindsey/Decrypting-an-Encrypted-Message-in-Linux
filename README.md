# Decrypting an Encrypted Message in Linux


## Objective

After learning about cryptography and decryption in Google Cybersecurity certificate course, the objective of this lab project was to use Linux commands to break Caesars cipher, decrypt files, and reveal hidden messages.

### Skills Learned/Used

- Use of 'ls' and 'ls -a' commands to list all files in current working directory
- Use of 'cat' command to list contents of file
- Use of 'cd' command to switch directories
- Use of 'cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"' command to decrypt Caesar cipher
- Use of 'openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute' command to decrypt encrypted file

### Tools Used

- Linux
